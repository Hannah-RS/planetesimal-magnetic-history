# learning-model
Remote repository for code developed to recreate Nimmo (2009), Bryson (2019) and Dodds (2021). Due to filesize issues in local repository created a new repository to sync with this one on 30/06/22. For version history before this date see local repository in Nimmo_test_model.

## What is in .gitignore?
Results and plots folders in each repo are not tracked as they are large and can all be recreated by rerunning the code from the parameters given in run info.
